# About Me

I've been fortunate to work my entire career as a programmer in Silicon Valley
for various icons of the tech industry, including Yahoo, AWS, Appcelerator, and
these past four years, for Google.

I'm currently the JavaScript advocacy lead at Google Cloud, and my goal is to
help other full stack developers succeed in building and running their apps on
Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
