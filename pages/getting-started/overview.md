# Overview

There are a few things you need to take care of:

1. Set up a GCP account if you don't already have one.
2. Set up your machine.
3. Set up a Google Cloud project.

The last step is something you need to do every time you create a new GCP
project. A GCP project is a collection of related applications and resources, so
you don't necessarily need to create a new project every time you want to deploy
another application unless they are unrelated to each other.
