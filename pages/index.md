# Introduction

GCP offers over one hundred services along with a dizzying array of online
resources. So many, indeed, that this is somewhat both a blessing and a curse.
For someone new to the cloud (or even just new to GCP), figuring out how and
where to start can certainly feel daunting.

I decided to put this guide together to share a clear, practical, and
opinionated orientation tailored specifically for full stack developers. To keep
it succinct, I focus mainly on the following:

- For programming, the language is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- For standalone API examples, the framework is [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- For full stack examples, the framework is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- For configuring infrastructure as code, the framework is [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

## What you'll learn

In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Build modern, full stack, scalable apps that run on GCP
- Leverage global load balancing and edge caching for enhancing performance
- Integrate your apps with other necessary or feature-enhancing services
- Customize your app's runtime process environment using a Dockerfile
- Configure and manage GCP resources with Infrastructure-as-Code

## What you should already know

To follow this guide, you don't need to be an expert, but you should at least
have basic proficiency doing the following:

- Use the command line in a terminal
- Program in TypeScript
