# Overview

There are a few Terraform files you'll need to configure for each GCP project:

- versions.tf
- variables.tf

These files use a simple configuration syntax called HashiCorp Configuration
Language (HCL).

You'll be introduced to these files over the next few pages, then dive into more
detail once it time to start deploying things.
